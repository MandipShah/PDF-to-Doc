Did you know that you can convert a PDF file to a word document using Python?
Python has a library called <strong>pdf2docx</strong>. with this library you can convert a <strong>pdf file</strong> to a <strong>word</strong> document with a few lines of code. Using pip, install the library:
<strong>pip install pdf2docx</strong>
We are going to import the converter class from this module. If the file is in the same directory as your Python script, then you can just provide the name of the file, instead of a link. The new doc file will be saved in the same directory.
